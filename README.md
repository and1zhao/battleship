# Battleship Curves
A program I created to make battleship curves for my archaeology course

### Instructions For Use
Since the library matplotlib requires Python to be used as a framework, you must set up a virtual environment and initiate it in order to utilize the library's functions. 

This can be done on MacOS using the following command (as long as Pip is installed):
> python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib

More documentation can be found at [this link](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
